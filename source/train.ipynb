As such, if your data contains data types and values that are not numbers, such as labels, you will need to change the data into numbers. Further, specific machine learning algorithms have expectations regarding the data types, scale, probability distribution, and relationships between input variables, and you may need to change the data to meet these expectations.\n","\n","The philosophy of data preparation is to discover how to best expose the unknown underlying structure of the problem to the learning algorithms. This often requires an iterative path of experimentation through a suite of different data preparation techniques in order to discover what works well or best. The vast majority of the machine learning algorithms you may use on a project are years to decades old. The implementation and application of the algorithms are well understood. So much so that they are routine, with amazing, fully-featured open-source machine learning libraries like scikit-learn in Python.\n","\n","The thing that is different from project to project is the data.\n","You may be the first person (ever!) to use a specific dataset as the basis for a predictive modeling project. As such, the preparation of the data in order to best present it to the problem of the learning algorithms is the primary task of any modern machine learning project.\n","\n","The challenge of data preparation is that each dataset is unique and different.\n","Datasets differ in the number of variables (tens, hundreds, thousands, or more), the types of the variables (numeric, nominal, ordinal, boolean), the scale of the variables, the drift in the values over time, and more. As such, this makes discussing data preparation a challenge. Either specific case studies are used, or focus is put on the general methods that can be used across projects.
